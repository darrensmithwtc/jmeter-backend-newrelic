### Plugin installation

Once you have built or downloaded the plugin JAR file from the [releases](https://github.com/darrensmithwtc/jmeter-backend-newrelic/releases) section,
move the JAR to your `$JMETER_HOME/lib/ext`.

```bash

Then, restart JMeter and the plugin should be loaded.

### JMeter configuration

To make JMeter send test result metrics to New Relic, in your **Test Pane**, right click on
**Thread Group** > Add > Listener > Backend Listener, and choose `io.github.darrensmithwtc.jmeter.backendlistener.newrelic.NewRelicBackendClient` as `Backend Listener Implementation`.
Then, in the Parameters table, configure the following attributes.
